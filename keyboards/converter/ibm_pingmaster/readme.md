![IBM 4704 Pingmaster](https://deskthority.net/wiki/images/d/da/6112884_1.jpg)

This is a port of TMK's converter/ibm4704_usb to QMK.

This firmware converts IBM 4704 keyboard protocol to USB HID.
Keyboard initialization process takes a few seconds at start up. You may need to plug USB cable after hooking up your keyboard to the converter.

# Connector

```
Keyboard Plug from front:

    DSUB-9
    -------------
    \ N 2 3 4 5 /
     \ N N N N /
      ---------
    2   GND
    3   VCC 5V
    4   DATA
    5   CLOCK
    N   No connection/No pin.

And VCC and GND, of course. See Resource section for keyboard connector pin assign.
```

# Connection

In case of using ATMega32U4/U2

1. Supply power with VCC and GND.
2. Connect CLOCK to PD1 and DATA to PD0. You can change pin with config.h.
3. Optionally you may need pull-up register. 1KOhm probably work.
